# mb-review — Multi-expert Memory Bank review

- **What it does:** runs independent reviewers over architecture, scope, backlog, security, and Memory Bank discipline.
- **Use it when:** you need a clean review gate before execution, after bootstrap, or before trusting the docs.
- **Input:** an existing `.memory-bank/` plus any repository ADR docs under `docs/` (`docs/adr/**/*.md`, `docs/adrs/**/*.md`, `docs/**/*ADR*.md`) when present.
- **Output:** reviewer reports in `.tasks/TASK-MB-REVIEW/` plus a synthesized list of fixes and review verdicts.

## Goal
Detect gaps, contradictions, broken traceability, and non-compliance early.

## Preconditions
- `.memory-bank/` exists.

## Process

### 1) Create review task folder
Create:
- `.tasks/TASK-MB-REVIEW/`

### 2) Spawn reviewers (fresh contexts)
Spawn these subagents in parallel (max 5–7):

1) Architect — `./agents/shared-review-architect.md`
2) Scope/RTM — `./agents/shared-review-scope.md`
3) Plan/backlog — `./agents/shared-review-plan.md`
4) Security — `./agents/shared-review-security.md`
5) MBB compliance — `./agents/shared-mb-reviewer.md`
6) Code quality (conditional: if repo has code) — `./agents/shared-review-code.md`

Each reviewer must:
- write a detailed report to `.tasks/TASK-MB-REVIEW/`
- return only a short summary + verdict to the orchestrator

### 3) Synthesize and decide
As orchestrator:
- combine findings
- deduplicate
- rank issues P0–P3
- produce a concrete fix plan

If the repo is preparing for `/autonomous`:
- treat unresolved P0/P1 issues as **blocking**
- do not allow batch execution until the final verdict is `APPROVE`

### 4) Gate
If any reviewer returns `REJECT`:
- fix MB
- re-run mb-review

## Definition of done
- `.tasks/TASK-MB-REVIEW/` contains the reviewer reports.
- Orchestrator produced an actionable prioritized fix list.
- Final verdict: APPROVE.
